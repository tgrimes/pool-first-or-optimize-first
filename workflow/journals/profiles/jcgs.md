## Scope

> "The purpose of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics (JCGS) is to improve and extend the use of computational and visualization methods in statistics and data analysis." [14]

> "Articles are written for readers who have a strong background in statistics but are not necessarily experts in computing." [15]

In plain terms, JCGS publishes new computational methods, algorithms, simulation design, and statistical graphics, read by statisticians who need not be computing experts [15]. Theory is welcome when it serves computation: "Articles of a theoretical nature are appropriate, provided that the results are relevant to computational statistics or data visualization" [14]. The ASA lists JCGS among its journals [1] and its style guide covers it [2]. Recent papers include a primer on designing simulation studies and several new permutation tests, so the group's simulation-and-diagnostic papers, especially ones that ship an R package and diagnostic plots, are the natural fit; a pure closed-form critique fits less well unless the fix is computational.

| Paper type | Fit | Why |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Critique with a closed-form bias, simulation, fix, and application | possible | Fits when the fix or diagnostic is a computational tool, as in the permutation-test papers found (Gómez et al. 2025). |
| Simulation and diagnostic, no closed form | good | The journal publishes simulation design work (Elliott et al. 2025) and computational tests evaluated by simulation. |
| Short methods note | good | Short Technical Notes are one of the journal's two article types [14], so a short computational note has its own format. |
| Theory paper | possible | Theoretical articles are appropriate when "the results are relevant to computational statistics or data visualization" [14], though pure theory without that link is not. |
| Applied analysis | poor | No applied-analysis papers were found; applications appear only as illustrations of methods. |

## Article types that fit

| Article type | Length | Figures and tables | References | Source |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------|--------|
| Article | the average paper "should be about 8,000 words, or the equivalent of approximately 35 double-spaced pages", including all appendices, references, tables, and figures | count toward the length | count toward the length | [14] |
| Short Technical Note | not recorded from the instructions page | not recorded | not recorded | [14] |

Formatting that is stated: submissions must be 12 point and fully double spaced, "which we define as 26 lines of text per page", and appendices of more than two paragraphs go into online supplements [2].

## Abstract

- Structured: no; the ASA style guide asks the abstract to "summarize results, topics discussed, and main conclusions" with no displays, no complex mathematical notation, and no references, and names no headings [2].
- Headings: none.
- Word limit: 200 words, per the ASA style guide, which covers JCGS [2]. The instructions page states no word limit or structure; it asks only that "The manuscript should contain an abstract and from three to 6 key words" [14]. The style guide says three to five key words (see Contradictions below) [2].

## Reference style

- The journal's stated style: ASA author-year style. The instructions say "Please use this ASA style guide", encourage BibTeX with the .bbl file submitted, and supply a LaTeX template as a zip file [14]. In the style guide, in-text citations give the author's surname and date ("Efron (2020)", or "(Lee 2008; Ludwig and Miller 2007)"); "et al." for three or more authors; the reference list is alphabetized, gives all authors (more than six may be cut to six plus "et al."), puts the year in parentheses followed by a comma, the article title in double quotation marks, the journal name spelled out in italics, volume, pages, and a DOI if available [2].
- CSL file: `dependent/journal-of-computational-and-graphical-statistics.csl` in the official styles repository (github.com/citation-style-language/styles, commit d2cc420, 2026-10-24), a dependent style whose parent is `american-statistical-association.csl`.
- File to use in Quarto: `csl/american-statistical-association.csl`, which renders offline. The journal-named `csl/dependent/journal-of-computational-and-graphical-statistics.csl` gives the same output but needs a network connection, because pandoc fetches the parent at render time.
- Rendering test: both files passed on 2026-10-27 (`csl/test-results.md`).

## Supplement, code, and data

- Supplementary material: supplements are subject to editorial review [14]. The style guide adds that appendices longer than two paragraphs must be online supplements, cited as "the online Appendix" or "online Appendix A"; the ASA "prefers that code and data are submitted as supplemental material" [2].
- Data availability statement: not recorded from the instructions page [14]. Taylor & Francis assigns each journal a data sharing tier stated in its Instructions for Authors [10].
- Code: expected with the manuscript. "Authors are expected to submit code and datasets as online supplements to the manuscript. Exceptions for reasons of security or confidentiality may be granted by the Editor." [14] The supplements are subject to editorial review [14]. Whether a public repository is required, and whether there is a reproducibility review beyond this editorial review, was not recorded from the instructions page [14].

## AI-use policy

> "Declaration of generative AI use. Please include a statement disclosing whether and how generative AI has been used in the research and manuscript preparation process." [14]

> "You must not list AI tools as a co-author of your article." "Please add a Declaration of generative AI use statement disclosing whether and how generative AI has been used." [3]
>
> "Taylor & Francis does not allow generative AI to create a first draft of a manuscript or sections of a manuscript." [4]

The first quotation is a checklist item on the JCGS instructions page [14]; the others are publisher-wide policies: the authorship page says its instructions "apply to all Taylor & Francis Group journals" [3], and the images page says the same [5]. Paraphrase of the rest: AI may improve spelling, grammar, and flow, but "cannot be used to create or conclude the argument of an article" [4]; AI may generate software code if the author reviews and verifies it [4]; the statement must give the tool's name and version, how and why it was used, and confirm that the authors take full responsibility for the content, including the accuracy of references [3, 4]; AI use in research methods must also be detailed in the methods section [4]; AI must not be used to create or manipulate images and figures from research data, AI help with data visualisations is allowed, and any AI-generated image needs a statement in its figure legend [5]. Reviewers and editors must not upload unpublished manuscripts to AI tools [6].

- What the manuscript must do: carry a "Declaration of generative AI use" statement naming each tool and version, saying how and why it was used and that the authors take full responsibility, repeat any methodological AI use in the Methods, and contain no AI-drafted text; neither the checklist item [14] nor the publisher pages say where in the manuscript the statement goes.

## Open access and charges

- Model: hybrid. The instructions offer optional open access through Open Select [14], and the Cost Finder lists JCGS under Open Select (hybrid) [8]. The ASA style guide says JCGS is copyrighted by the ASA and "Authors are able to retain copyright and make articles Open Access through payment of the Article Processing Charge (APC)" [2]; Taylor & Francis calls this option Open Select, "often referred to as "hybrid open access"" [7].
- Article processing charge: none unless the authors choose open access. "There are no submission fees, publication fees or page charges for this journal." Colour in print costs $400 per figure [14]. The open access charge is USD 3,940 for "Original Article", with the country set to United States; read 2026-10-27 [8].
- Waivers and institutional agreements: "You may be eligible for a reduced or fully-waivered APC if your institution has an agreement with Taylor & Francis." [7]

## Review

- Model: single anonymized, with double anonymized on request. "JCGS is now reviewed using a single-anonymous system, with an author option for double-anonymous review." A PDF is submitted at initial submission [14].
- Time to decision: 15 days on average from submission to first decision; 116 days on average to the first post-review decision; 80 days on average from acceptance to online publication; acceptance rate 15% [15].

Practical note: the ScholarOne page says all new JCGS submissions go through Taylor & Francis's new Submission Portal, and ScholarOne is kept only for revisions of submissions started there [11].
