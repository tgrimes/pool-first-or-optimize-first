## Scope

> "We publish original research from all areas of the natural sciences, psychology, medicine and engineering." [1]

In plain terms, this is a very large, broad, open access journal that accepts any technically sound paper; editors and reviewers judge "the robustness and validity of your research" rather than its likely impact [4]. Readers are general scientists, so a genomics methods paper will reach fewer specialists than in a bioinformatics journal, but the bar for novelty is lower and short papers are welcome. It is a reasonable home for the group's applied analyses, short notes, and simulation studies; critiques can go here when a specialist journal declines.

| Paper type | Fit | Why |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Critique with a closed-form bias, simulation, fix, and application | possible | Sound methods papers are accepted [4], and a PERMANOVA-based evaluation with simulated and real data appeared here (paper 2 below), but the audience is general. |
| Simulation and diagnostic, no closed form | possible | Validity, not novelty, is the criterion [4], so a well-designed simulation study qualifies; it may get less attention from specialists. |
| Short methods note | good | Word limits are recommendations, and the journal suggests at most 4 display items for articles of 2,000 words or less [5], so short articles are normal. |
| Theory paper | poor | Mathematics and statistics are not among the listed subject areas [1]. |
| Applied analysis | good | Original research in biology and health sciences is the journal's core content [1], [3]. |

## Article types that fit

| Article type | Length | Figures and tables | References | Source |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------|--------|
| Article | main text recommended at most 4,500 words (excluding Abstract, Methods, References, and figure legends); ideally at most 11 typeset pages; "we do not impose strict limits" | at most 8 display items; for 2,000 words or less, no more than 4 suggested; legends at most 350 words | "limited to 60 references, though not strictly enforced" | [5] |

## Abstract

- Structured: no; "Abstract should be unstructured, i.e. should not contain sections or subheadings." [5], [6]
- Headings: none. No references or figures in the abstract; it should serve as a general introduction and a brief, non-technical summary [5].
- Word limit: 200 (recommended) [5]

## Reference style

- The journal's stated style: "standard Nature referencing style", numbered sequentially, one publication per number; list all authors unless there are six or more, then first author followed by "et al." [5]. In-text citations are numbers in square brackets [6]. References are not copy edited, so they must be correct at submission [5].
- CSL file: `dependent/scientific-reports.csl` in the official styles repository (github.com/citation-style-language/styles, commit d2cc420, 2026-10-24), a dependent style whose parent is `nature-brackets.csl`.
- File to use in Quarto: `csl/nature-brackets.csl`, which renders offline. The journal-named `csl/dependent/scientific-reports.csl` gives the same output but needs a network connection, because pandoc fetches the parent at render time.
- Rendering test: both files passed on 2026-10-27 (`csl/test-results.md`).

## Supplement, code, and data

- Supplementary material: one combined Supplementary Information file, preferably PDF, submitted with the manuscript; not edited or typeset; no appendices in the main text [5].
- Data availability statement: mandatory, as a "Data Availability" section at the end of the main text before References [5], [6]. "Supporting data must be made available to Editorial Board Members and referees at the time of submission" [7].
- Code: authors "must provide any previously unreported custom computer code or algorithm used to generate results upon editor or reviewer request" and the Methods must include a "Code availability" statement [7]. A public repository is not required: the journal will publish the code as a Supplementary document or, when applicable, ask that it be kept in a version control repository [7]. No reproducibility review is stated on the site.

## AI-use policy

> "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, do not currently satisfy our authorship criteria." [5]

> "Use of an LLM should be properly documented in the Methods section (and if a Methods section is not available, in a suitable alternative part) of the manuscript." [5]

> "Specific disclosure should be provided within the caption or legend of the visual content." [11]

The journal's AI page reproduces the Springer Nature risk framework: language polishing is permitted and disclosure is encouraged; suggesting methods, extensive writing support, or explaining model output are permitted with human oversight and disclosure; generating analyses or conclusions presented as human work, fabricating data or citations, or assigning authorship to AI are not permitted [8]. AI images not derived from verifiable data are not permitted [11].

- Read at: https://www.nature.com/srep/journal-policies/ai and https://www.nature.com/srep/author-instructions/submission-guidelines, 2026-10-27.
- What the manuscript must do: describe in the Methods section which AI tools were used and for what, state that the authors checked the output and take responsibility, and label any AI-assisted figure in its legend.

## Open access and charges

- Model: fully open access [10]
- Article processing charge: US$2,850 (also £2,290 and €2,490), subject to VAT or local taxes, set by the acceptance date; read 2026-10-27 [10]
- Waivers and institutional agreements: Springer Nature waivers for authors in the lowest-income countries; discretionary waivers for financial need must be requested at submission; institutional open access agreements may cover the charge [10]

## Review

- Model: reviewers are anonymous to authors: "By policy, referees are not identified to the authors, except at the request of the referee." [9] Author names appear on the manuscript title page [5], so this works as single anonymized review, although the site does not use that term. Publication of reviewer reports is not stated on the site.
- Time to decision: "We aim to make our first decisions on your manuscript within 45 days of submission." [4] This is a target, not a measured figure. The home page gives a median of 102 days from submission to acceptance for papers in Guest Edited Collections only [2]. No journal-wide measured figure is stated.

Variability in donor leukocyte counts confound the use of common RNA sequencing data normalization strategies in transcriptomic biomarker studies performed with whole blood. *Scientific Reports* 13:15514. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-41443-4. It shows that standard normalizations assume similar transcriptome composition and are confounded by cell counts in blood, a cell-composition critique of routine practice checked against flow cytometry truth.

It evaluates PERMANOVA and a robust effect size for detecting batch effects in simulated and real data, the same distance-based test the group studies.

## Not stated on the site, or could not be read

- Whether reviewer reports are published (transparent review): not stated on the site (sources 4, 7, and 9).
- A measured journal-wide time to first decision: not stated on the site (sources 2, 3, and 4); the URL `https://www.nature.com/srep/journal-impact` redirects to the About page, which lists citation metrics only.
- Which length limits are mandatory: the guidelines point to the submission checklist [5], and the checklist lists no word or page limit [6].
