## Scope

> "iScience is a peer-reviewed journal from Cell Press that provides a platform for original research in the life, physical, earth, sustainability, and health sciences. We aim to fuel interdisciplinary thinking and consider research with significant contribution to a relevant field combined with robust results and underlying methodology." [5]

In plain terms, iScience is a broad open access Cell Press journal for original research across the sciences, read by a broad scientific audience. It says it will "consider replication studies and papers describing negative results, provided they offer clear value to the research community" [5], which opens the door to a critique. Two items on its out-of-scope list matter for the group [5]:

> "Datamining studies using single datasets without experimental validation in original or external cohorts and strong originality, novelty and advance." [5]

> "Machine-learning or artificial intelligence methods without benchmarking against similar methods and demonstrated superior performance." [5]

The journal also runs Matters Arising, "a venue for research papers that directly and definitively challenge the main take-home message of a previously published iScience paper" [7]; LIONESS was published in iScience. Among its genomics papers are applied uses of sample-specific co-expression networks (paper 2 below), a critique of the standard normalization for a spatial transcriptomics platform with an alternative pipeline (paper 1 below), and simulation-backed limits on what single-cell data can estimate (paper 3 below).

| Paper type | Fit | Why |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Critique with a closed-form bias, simulation, fix, and application | good | The aims consider negative results of clear value [5], and Matters Arising, at full research-article length, exists for papers that challenge a published iScience paper such as LIONESS [7]. |
| Simulation and diagnostic, no closed form | possible | Simulation-backed limits on an estimation task appear (paper 3 below), but the journal asks for "significant contribution to a relevant field combined with robust results" [5]. |
| Short methods note | poor | Research Articles and Matters Arising share one long format, and papers that "are technically accurate but do not report a significant contribution will not be considered" [7]. |
| Theory paper | poor | No pure statistical theory found among published genomics papers, and the aims ask for robust results and methodology in an applied field [5]. |
| Applied analysis | possible | Applied sample-specific network papers appear (paper 2 below), but single-dataset data mining without validation in an original or external cohort is out of scope [5], so a lupus reanalysis needs a second cohort. |

## Article types that fit

| Article type | Length | Figures and tables | References | Source |
|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------------|--------|
| Research Article | advised below 8,000 words; detailed methods go in STAR Methods | not stated on the site | not stated on the site | [7] |
| Matters Arising (only on papers published in iScience) | same format and length as Research Articles; no revisions permitted | not stated on the site | not stated on the site | [7] |

## Abstract

- Structured: no; "The summary is a single paragraph of no more than 150 words" [9]
- Headings: none
- Word limit: 150 [9]

## Reference style

- The journal's stated style: "References should be sequentially numbered according to their first citation in the manuscript." [9]
- CSL file: `dependent/iscience.csl` in the official styles repository (github.com/citation-style-language/styles, commit d2cc420, 2026-10-24), a dependent style whose parent is `cell.csl`, a numbered style. That matches the site, which asks for references numbered in order of first citation.
- File to use in Quarto: `csl/cell.csl`, which renders offline. The journal-named `csl/dependent/iscience.csl` gives the same output but needs a network connection, because pandoc fetches the parent at render time.
- Rendering test: both files passed on 2026-10-27 (`csl/test-results.md`).

## Supplement, code, and data

- Supplementary material: general rules were not recorded; original code may be placed in the supplemental information instead of a repository [8].
- Data availability statement: not recorded from the journal policies page (source 8).
- Code: "All original code must be deposited in a repository that mints DOIs or included in the supplemental information before a paper is accepted for publication." [8] So a DOI-minting repository or the supplement is required by acceptance, not at submission.

## AI-use policy

> "Authors must declare the use of generative AI in scientific manuscript preparation upon submission" [8]

- The declaration "should be placed in a new section after the "declaration of interests" section" [8]. This is the Cell Press text, and it takes precedence over Elsevier's general page [3] (see Contradictions).
- Elsevier's general policy adds: "Authors should not list AI tools as an author or co-author, nor cite AI tools as an author," and "AI tools must not be used to create or alter images that represent primary observed or experimental data." [3]
- Read at: https://www.cell.com/iscience/information-for-authors/journal-policies (journal), 2026-10-27, and https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies-and-standards/generative-ai-policies-for-journals (Elsevier, page says "Policy updated June 2026"), 2026-10-27.
- What the manuscript must do: declare AI use at submission in a new section right after the Declaration of interests, naming each tool and its use, and never list AI as an author.

## Open access and charges

- Model: fully open access ("Full Open Access") [1]
- Article processing charge: USD 3,240, excluding taxes, prices as of 05-Oct-2026, read 2026-10-27; the list also gives EUR 2,960, GBP 2,590, and JPY 421,950 [1]
- Waivers and institutional agreements: could not be read (https://www.cell.com/open-access returned 403); the Elsevier pricing page [2] does not mention Cell Press.

## Review

- Model: single anonymized; Cell Press uses single-anonymous peer review as its standard, and iScience does not take suggested reviewers [10].
- Time to decision: median 6 days to first editorial decision and median 4 days from acceptance to online publication [6].

## Not stated on the site, or could not be read

- Figure, table, and reference limits for Research Articles: not stated on the site (article types page, source 7).
- Data availability statement and general supplementary material rules: not recorded from the journal policies page (source 8).
- Publishing options and waivers: could not be read (https://www.cell.com/open-access, HTTP 403); no iScience publishing options page was read, so the model and APC rest on the price list [1].
- STAR Methods guides: could not be read (https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/research/cell/methods/Methods_Guide_general-1678470557763.pdf and https://www.cell.com/pb-assets/journals/EM/MasterFFCs/ISCIFFC-1781892786367.pdf, HTTP 403).
- Online ISSN on a cell.com page: not recorded; the ISSN above comes from the price list [1].
- ScienceDirect journal page: could not be read (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/iscience, HTTP 403).

Contradictions:

- AI declaration placement: Elsevier's general policy [3], which this profile earlier followed, puts the declaration immediately before the references. The iScience policy [8] puts it in a new section after the declaration of interests. The journal's rule governs.
